This directory contains the some of the contents of the *outputs* portion 
of the CoNLL-2003 dataset.

The structure of subdirectories is the same as in the original archive
`ner.tgz`, but unnecessary files and directories are omitted from source 
control.

We have also edited the output files to make them line up properly with 
the current version of the corpus.

You can obtain the original full data set data yourself 
from [here](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/),
or you can directly download `ner.tgz`
from [here](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner.tgz).
